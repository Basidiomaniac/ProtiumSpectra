12 Nov 2025 - Started log. Currently have asd_cleanup.R, asd_identify.R, and asd_analyze.R
Added the package prospectr to splice gaps in ASD readings. Looks like the gaps are due to the spectrometer used having three separate readers,
which splice their data together to create the final file. spliceCorrection() from prospectr works well to flatten these. This is now
incorporated into asd_cleanup.R
